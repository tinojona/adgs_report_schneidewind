## Telling a story from data
### Introduction:

Ozone and health impacts, urgency

- Research questions: 
When is human health most threatened?
ppb threshold = 51 ppb (100 ug/m3)
- timeseries plot
- heatmap (months/weekdays)

How well can we predict this threat best based on other variables to extrapolate this threat to other areas?


### Methods
- description of the airquality data set: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/airquality

method for exposure: WHO threshold

method for precicatbility: lm using Wind/Solar.R/Temp


because we are interested in the outliers we wont correct for them.

### Notes
- At least three statistical metrics from your dataset that aid you in answering your question (e.g., mean values, ranges, etc.).
- At least three publishable figures or tables that show important relationships that aid you in answering your question (e.g., outliers, temporal patterns, scatterplots, etc.).
- Make sure to interpret and discuss your results and hypotheses. Why were you right / why were you wrong?Make sure to interpret and discuss your results and hypotheses. Why were you right / why were you wrong?
- max 400 words (aka 700)
- Do I need to scale for lm()? Kinda not but could be nice to try out
